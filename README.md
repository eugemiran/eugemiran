# 👋 Hi, I'm Eugenia Miranda

I'm a **Staff Frontend Engineer** based in **Uruguay**, with 6+ years of experience building web and mobile applications for U.S.-based startups and enterprises. I specialize in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shopify**, crafting clean, scalable architectures that balance performance with beautiful UI.

## 🌱 A Bit About Me

When I'm not coding, I'm likely:
- 🏸 Practicing tennis (beginner but loving it!)
- 🗺️ Planning my next trip — recently: 🇹🇭Thailand and 🇵🇹 Portugal
- 💬 Talking about frontend performance or JavaScript architecture at local meetups
